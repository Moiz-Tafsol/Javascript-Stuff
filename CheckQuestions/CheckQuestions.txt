var a = 10
function xyz() {
  var a = 20

What are promises, and what are their states?
Ans) Promises are made for when its not certain what value will be returned, for example a call from the internet or from a database.

What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
Synchronous programming means every instruction will be executed one after another, therefore intructions will have to wait for previous instructions to run to work. 
In asynchronous programming, this blocking mechanism can be bypassed and allows instructions to continue executing and not be hindered by waiting instructions.
Await, promises, etc

promises   // thread backend execute  
 // main thread child thread await 


Write a function in JS that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.
Ans)
const summer = (arr) => {
    let sum = 0

    for (let i = 0; i < arr?.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
            sum += arr[i]
        }
    }

    return sum;
}

Write a function in Node.js that returns the second-largest number in an array.
Ans)
const second = (arr) => {
    let sum = 0

    let abc = arr.sort((a,b)=> b-a)

    return abc[1];
}

Difference between array.slice vs array.splice?
Ans) Slice does not change the original array and creates a copy of the elements in a new array while removing some values.
     Splice does change the original array and implements the removal of elements directly in the original array.

Remove duplicate items in array.

const arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 2, 4, 5, 7];
dublicate = () => {
Ans) return arr.filter((value, index) => arr.indexOf(value) === index)
}
dublicate();

 data = [
//   { id: 1, name: "mughira", task: "did react", date: "12,6,2022" },
//   { id: 2, name: "ramaz", task: "did nextjs", date: "15,6,2022" },
//   { id: 3, name: "hamza", task: "did larawell", date: "13,6,2022" },
//   { id: 4, name: "umer", task: "did node", date: "14,6,2022" },
//   { id: 5, name: "ahsan", task: "did html", date: "13,6,2022" },
//   { id: 6, name: "ahmed", task: "did css", date: "13,6,2022" },
// ];
seperate all the data by dates the length of the data can be anything

Ans) data.map((item) =>{
        
    })
